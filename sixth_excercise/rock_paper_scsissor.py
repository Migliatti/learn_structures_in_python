# Lucas wants to create a rock, paper, and scissors game to play against the computer. He needs a program that allows the user to choose an option and then displays the result of the match.

# Create a program that allows the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will randomly choose an option. The program should display who won the match. Remember that:

#     Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors);
#     Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cuts Paper);
#     Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock);
#     If both choose the same option, it's a tie.
